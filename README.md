# ESO Role-Play Town Portal Tool

This is a web tool for editing data used by the [Role-Play Town Portals](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info3471-Role-PlayTownPortals.html) addon for The Elder Scrolls Online.

This allows town builders to set up their locations and conections themselves, and then when the changes are ready for release, the addon developer simply needs to export their changes to a file and include it in the new version.
